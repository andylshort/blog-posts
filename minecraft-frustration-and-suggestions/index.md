## I ❤️ Minecraft

Don't misread my intentions of this post: I love Minecraft, I've put more hours into and made more many memories in this game than I have any other. The problems I highlight and suggestions put forward come from a place of love to make the game that much more fun and exciting to play.

...

## Central Problems
* "Hardcore" isn't a challenge
* Barely any survival aspects to it
* Bifurcation of Java and Bedrock was a mistake
  * Feature differences
    * Bundles removed...
  * Performance differences
  * No multiplayer between the two
* Mod API...
* Fletching table...
* Performance
  * My 16GB, i7-6700k, GTX 1070 can barely run modern minecraft
    * have to use Fabric and a plethora of performance mods - Sodium, Lithium etc. just to get a playable frame-rate
* Enchanting isn't worth doing with villager trading in the game
* Mending makes tool repair useless

## Suggestions

* More regional mobs and mob variants
* More crops and plants
* Vertical slabs, sideways stairs, variants of those for blocks that don't have them
* The End
  * Point of the end cities?
  * More points of interest
  * More mobs
  * Different types of islands
  * End grass?
* Deep dark cities
  * Redstone education room is vastly pointless
  * "Portal" frame does not have any use
* Inventory management is heinous
  * Backpacks
  * Tabs in inventory
    * Expensive recipe for unlocks? Rare trade from villagers? item from deep dark, end, or dungeons?

### Villages and Villagers
* Village improvements
  * Roads
  * Smarter villagers
  * Better villages
* Villagers
  * Need to be smarter
  * Need to be easier to work with
  * Trading with them is broken - why bother exploring??

### Exploration
* Mob spawners/dungeons desperately need an update (TODO: Reference Grian video.)
  * Mobs shouldn't spawn randomly anymore
    * They should be spawned from improved mob spawners, all underground or in side of mountains etc.
    * They feed mobs onto the surface and into the surroundings
    * Mob strength/variants get harder the nearer to the spawner you are
    * Pros:
      * Improves exploration
      * Would require player to travel to set up a mob farm for them and build infrastructure
      * Survival aspect enhanced as need to gear up to take them on
      * No need for torches to prevent mod spawns everywhere

### Survival

### Technical Minecraft
* Movable tile entities - parity with Bedrock!
* Faster minecarts
* Crafting table automation
* Filters on hoppers

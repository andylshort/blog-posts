Problem? Can't view anything without an account. Enshittification. Trying to recoup lost profit. Walled gardens. Bad for internet health. etc. Used to be able to view directly-linked tweets but no longer. View of twitter feeds when not longed it hides lots of tweets - seemingly either from the date of acquisition or at random. Need account to view up-to-date and all tweets from author.


Issues:

- Human verification was unintuitive.
- Onboarding flow was clunky
- Two of the three recommended accounts to follow: Musk and Trump...
- "For You" was the default view/feed... 
- Randomly named CSS classes on div elements to prevent blocking and page customisation...
